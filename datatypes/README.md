## # DATA TYPES

<br/>

## Q. ***What are data types in javascript?***

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript.

|Data Types	  | Description	                         |Example                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|String	      |Represents textual data	             |let str = 'Hi', let str2 = "Hello", let str3 = \`Hello World\`|
|Number	      |An integer or a floating-point number |let num = 3, let num2 = 3.234, let num3 = 3e-2 |
|BigInt	      |An integer with arbitrary precision	 |let num = 900719925124740999n, let num = 1n    |
|Boolean	    |Any of two values: true or false	     |let flag = true             |
|undefined	  |A data type whose variable is not initialized	|let a;             |
|null	        |Denotes a null value	                 |let a = null;               |
|Symbol	      |Data type whose instances are unique and immutable|let value = Symbol('hello');|
|Object	      |key-value pairs of collection of data	|let student = { };         |

**String:**

`String` is used to store text. In JavaScript, strings are surrounded by quotes:

* Single quotes: 'Hello'
* Double quotes: "Hello"
* Backticks: \`Hello\`

Example:

```js
// Strings
const firstName = "Mukul";
const lastName = "Mittal";
const result = `Name: ${firstName} ${lastName}`;

console.log(result); // Name: Mukul Mittal
```

**Number:**

Number represents integer and floating numbers (decimals and exponentials). A number type can also be `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (not a number).

```js
const number1 = 3;
const number2 = 3.433;
const number3 = 3e5; // 3 * 10^5

const number4 = 3 / 0;
console.log(number4); // Infinity

const number5 = -3 / 0;
console.log(number5); // -Infinity

// strings can't be divided by numbers
const number6 = "abc" / 3;
console.log(number6); // NaN
```

**BigInt:**

In JavaScript, Number type can only represent numbers less than (2<sup>53</sup> - 1) and more than -(2<sup>53</sup> - 1). However, if you need to use a larger number than that, you can use the BigInt data type.

A BigInt number is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer.

```js
// BigInt value
const num1 = 900719925124740998n;
const num2 = 900719925124740998n;
const num3 = 10;


// Adding two big integers
const result1 = num1 + num2;
console.log(result1); // "1801439850249481996n"


// Error! BitInt and number cannot be added
const result2 = num1 + num2 + num3; 
console.log(result2);  // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types
```

**Boolean:**

This data type represents logical entities. Boolean represents one of two values: `true` or `false`. 

```js
const dataChecked = true;
const valueCounted = false;
```

**undefined:**

The undefined data type represents value that is not assigned. If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined. 

```js
let name;
console.log(name); // undefined

let name = undefined;
console.log(name); // undefined
```

**null:**

In JavaScript, `null` is a special value that represents empty or unknown value.

```js
const number = null;
```

**Symbol:**

A value having the data type Symbol can be referred to as a symbol value. Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique.

```js
// Two symbols with the same description

const value1 = Symbol('hello');
const value2 = Symbol('hello');

let result = (value1 === value2) ? true : false;  // false;

// Note: Though value1 and value2 both contain 'hello', they are different as they are of the Symbol type.
```

**Object:**

An object is a complex data type that allows us to store collections of data. 

```js
const employee = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'K',
    email: 'john.k@gmail.com'
};
```

    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

## Q. ***What is `undefined` property?***

The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

```js
var user;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
console.log(typeof(user)) //undefined
```

Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

```js
user = undefined
```

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

## Q. ***What is difference between `null` vs `undefined`?***

**Null:**

`Null` means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.

```js
var test = null;
console.log(test); // null
```

`null` is also an object. Interestingly, this was actually an error in the original JavaScript implementation:

```js
console.log(typeof test); // object
```

**Undefined:**

Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined. For example:

```js
var test2;
console.log(test2); // undefined
```

Unlike null, undefined is of the type undefined:

```js
console.log(typeof test2); // undefined
```

**Difference:**

| Null | Undefined |
|---- | -----------|
| It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.  | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
| Type of null is object | Type of undefined is undefined  |
| The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.|
| Indicates the absence of a value for a variable | Indicates absence of variable itself |
| Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations |
